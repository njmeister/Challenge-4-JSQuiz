# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge 4 -- JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This is my submission for the fourth challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this challenge was to create an interactive quiz with JavaScript.
The website presents you with a series of questions related to JavaScript. Once you have correctly answered them all, you are given a score based on your time.

## Usage
The website first presents you with an introduction to the quiz. Upon starting, you will be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions. If you choose incorrectly, 10 seconds are subtracted from the 5-minute timer, 
and the question is reentered at the end of the quiz. Once you answer all the questions correctly, you will be presented with a score based on the time it took you to complete. If your score is in the top 5 high scores 
saved locally, you are presented with an opportunity to add your initials to the displayed high scores.
